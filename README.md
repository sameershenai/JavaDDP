# JavaDDP
Distributed Data Protocol in Java

DDP is a protocol between a client and a server that supports two operations:

Remote procedure calls by the client to the server.
The client subscribing to a set of documents, and the server keeping the client informed about the contents of those documents as they change over time.

Spec from Meteor's DDP : https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/ddp/DDP.md
